**Hi**

I have been looking for an application to notify me when a stream goes online, but i couldn't find any...
So i decided to make my own.

At the moment the application takes your Twitch.tv username and uses the [Twitch API](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API "https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API") to get the Channels you are following and notify you when they come online.

I plan on updating it if there is a demand for it:
* Other Stream Clients
* And more
